# Hi, I'm Regita Zakia 👋

**Data Science in Tech, Policy, and Academic | Economics and Sustainability Research | Product Data Analyst**

I'm passionate about using data science and machine learning in:
- **Tech Company:** to drive product decisions and understand user behavior through rigorous experimentation, causal inference, and personalization at scale.
- **Policy:** to design and evaluate evidence-based, equitable policies using causal inference, program evaluation, and data analytics.
- **Academic:** to develop interpretable, reliable ML methods and publish open, reproducible research in economics and sustainability.

Currently pursuing my M.S. in Applied Analytics at Columbia University.

## 🔧 Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL, Stata
- **ML/AI:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NLP, Statistical Modeling
- **Analytics:** A/B Testing, Causal Inference, Time Series Analysis, Panel Data Analysis
- **Visualization:** Tableau, PowerBI, Matplotlib, ggplot2
- **Tools:** Git, Jupyter, Docker, AWS

## 👩🏼‍💻 Projects in Technology Companies

### [📊 A/B Testing Framework](./ab-testing-framework) 
End-to-end experimentation framework with statistical hypothesis testing, sample size calculation, and causal inference methods.

### [💬 NLP Sentiment Analysis](./nlp-sentiment-analysis)
Social media sentiment analysis using topic modeling (LDA) and categorization, preventing $10M+ in marketing losses.

### [👥 User Behavior Clustering](./user-behavior-clustering)
RFM clustering analysis for user segmentation and churn prediction using unsupervised learning techniques.


## 🌎 Projects in Policy

### [📊 World Bank and UN SDGs Indicators Data](./sdgs-data) 
Daily pull from World Bank/UN-Data APIs for 20 SDG indicators

### [👶🏼 Subnational Child Vulnerability Index (CVI) & Atlas](./cvi-atlas)
A reproducible pipeline that builds and updates a district-level CVI (poverty + WASH + education + health + hazards), outputs tidy CSVs, interactive maps, and a short policy brief.

### [💰 Project Outcomes Explorer: World Bank Ops × Outcome Proxies (DiD)](./outcome-explorer)
Dashboard measuring how WB projects correlate with changes in outcome proxies (nightlights, travel time to school/health, WASH) using difference-in-differences on geocoded locations.

## 📚 Projects in Academic Research

### [💧 Water-use in the US Forecast](./water-use-forecast)
Forecasted long-range time series data of water-use in the US and integrated climate & state-level data to inform regional water-risk

### [🏥 In-patient Hospitalization Forecast](./hospitalization-forecast)
Forecasted panel data on the rate of hospitalization by state in the US

### [👨🏼‍⚖️ Deduplication of Congressional Bills](./congressional-bills)
Deduplicated, cleaned, and integrated US congressional bills data to form a global database


## 📈 Impact
- Led AI model evaluation in tech companies for 100M+ users
- Managed $16M+ strategic decisions through A/B testing and policy briefs
- Built ML models preventing $xxM+ losses in marketing budget
- Reduced reporting time by 90% with automated dashboards
